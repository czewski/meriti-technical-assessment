does it make it faster? should store the time of execution. 


## Experiment 1
# Method: Using different image sizes during training.
    - 128 256 512

# Purpose: I think that the image size won't interfere much in the training results, but smaller images may make the model train faster. 

# Experimental process: Using a bash script to change the values by argument parsing in the python main runner.

# Results: 

- Loss curve
- Stats 
- Comparison
